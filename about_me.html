I have been working with computers since I was 15 years old. What started as a gaming hobby transitioned <br />
into much more when my computer started malfunctioning and I couldnt play my favourite game. <br />
I immediately picked up the phone and called tech support, but was given the run around, <br />
and never got help with my issue. Luckily, I could still connect to the internet, and frustrated, <br />
I started looking for a solution to my problem. <br />
<br />
After several days of searching, and trial and error I fixed my computer. I was very proud<br />
and this encouraged me, and got me very interested in the field of information technology. I bought books, <br />
I read a lot, and I found the right people on the internet who answered my questions when I ran into trouble.<br />
<br />
It was a very rocky road. I was often so frustrated that I wanted to just drop everyhting and never <br />
come back to it again, but I dont get discouraged easily, and my meticulous, methodic nature paid off.<br />
After destroying several expensive parts which I spent months saving for, I really learned my lesson and from that point<br />
I was very successful with my computer builds.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I became confident enough to get certified as a professional computer technician. I studied <br />
for a few months and then I went and passed the <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getcertified/certifications/a.aspx" target= "_blank">Comp TIA A+ </a>exam on my 1st try.<br />
<br />
Right now, I am more experienced than ever, thanks to my job in a large educational organization where <br />
I run into various problems and have to develop solutions on the fly. I am certain of my abilities <br />
and there is no probem I canot solve as long as a solution exists.<br />
<br />

Right now, I am gradurating with a Bachelors degree in Data Communications, and I plan to propel
my career to new heights with a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcts.aspx" target= "_blank">MCTS</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html" target= "_blank">Cisco</a> certifications which I am studying for.
